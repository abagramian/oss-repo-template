**Why is it important to choose a license?**

Choosing a license is important for telling other developers how your software should be used. Licenses also allow you to protect yourself legally - if anyone were to violate the license you chose, you could take legal action against them without issue.

**Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**

If a project doesn't have an explicit license, it means that the creator of the project holds an exclusive copyright for it. This also applies to each new contributor to the project. If everyone has exclusive rights to a project, then no one has rights to the project, and if anything were to happen because of this, the project could crash and become unusable. 


**Do you agree with "Why the Web beat Gopher"?**


**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?**
