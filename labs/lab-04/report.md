**Why is it important to choose a license?**

Choosing a license is important for telling other developers how your software should be used. Licenses also allow you to protect yourself legally - if anyone were to violate the license you chose, you could take legal action against them without issue.

**Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**

If a project doesn't have an explicit license, it means that the creator of the project holds an exclusive copyright for it. This also applies to each new contributor to the project. If everyone has exclusive rights to a project, then no one has rights to the project, and if anything were to happen because of this, the project could crash and become unusable. 


**Do you agree with the claim "failure to follow the open system model" claim from "Why the Web beat Gopher"?**

I agree that Gophers failure to follow the open system model contributed to its downfall. One of the most important aspects of software is users, and by not catering to the needs of the users, Gopher wasn't able to keep up. Users will migrate to other tools that allow them to work more efficiently, which is often something they can customize for theri own purposes. 

**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?**

Android uses the Apache license 2.0 for a multitude of reasons listed on their website: https://source.android.com/setup/start/licenses. The Apache license 2.0 allows for modification without the requirement of distribution of any derivative work, since it is a permissive license. The Android website states that they do not wish to force developers to obey a copyleft license, since it adds uneccesary complexity. They state that "historically, LGPL libraries have been the source of many compliance problems for downstream device makers and application developers." This also allows them to remain as open as possible, which is a philosiphy they state on their website. 

The Android Kernel is based on Linux, which is licensed under GPLv2. This license states that any derivative software must be released under the same license, therefore the Android kernel must be released under the GPLv2 license as well.
