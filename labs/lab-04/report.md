**Why is it important to choose a license?**


**Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**


**Do you agree with "Why the Web beat Gopher"?**


**Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?**


**5 past RCOS projects licensing**
