Next implement a variation where we consider two words (nodes) to be adjacent if there is a one letter difference without regard to ordering. You will need to change the edit_distance_one function to disregard letter position. Test with:

chaos to order
plots to graph
moron to smart
flies to swims
mango to peach
pound to marks
